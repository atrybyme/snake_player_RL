# Snake Player - An approach using Reinforcement Learning
**Repository in under construction**
## Results:
The algorithm learns to beat traditional data using pixel data from game environment(the game environment is in the repository itself.)
(The game is traditional snake game with food appearing on random states.)
### Images of the results in the order of learning episodes.

**As one can see the model outperforms the environment getting almost full possible score.The model qalso learns to avoid different traps by the game.**
